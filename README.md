# GARDEN Chat Archaeology Project

Systematic extraction and analysis of artifacts, decisions, and backlog items from GARDEN conversation history.

## Structure
- `chat-artifacts/` - Extracted artifacts from conversations
- `conversation-exports/` - Paste.txt exports from old chats
- `analysis/` - Comparison tools and analysis scripts  
- `findings/` - Discovered items and recommendations

## Purpose
Ensure no strategic decisions, artifacts, or backlog items exist only in conversation history.

## Process
1. Extract conversation exports
2. Run artifact analysis prompts
3. Compare against current systems
4. Integrate findings into core GARDEN

Part of the GARDEN ecosystem archaeology and optimization project.
